Write a function that concatenates two strings.
•	Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
•	This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
•	Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest
Write a function that concatenates two strings.
•	Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
•	The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
o	it will use at most n bytes from src; and
o	src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
•	Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
Write a function that copies a string.
•	Prototype: char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
•	Your function should work exactly like strncpy
Write a function that compares two strings.
•	Prototype: int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
•	Your function should work exactly like strcmp
